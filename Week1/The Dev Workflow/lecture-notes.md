How do I take off as a dev?

An important trait to have as a developer is critical skills and problem solving. They go hand-in-hand, since as devs we are facing new situations and solving problems to make code provide the results that we are expecting. 

In this lecture, we presented a problem and demostrated ways to tackle it: breaking the problem down, work iteratively and incrementaly, debugging, try out ideas and manually testing and, more.   

The code presented in class can be found under the /code folder.
