# Taking off as a Dev

## Goals : Demonstrate How to:
* Work iteratively and incrementally
* Debug
* Manually test our code
* Donâ€™t repeat yourself
* Writing clean code 
* Facilitate deeper learning of coding concepts - a simple repeat does add substantial value



## Algorithm 
1. User picks a number between 1 and 3 - (door that opens) - saved as x
2. Player 1 selects to open door x
3. Player 2 selects to open door x

4. Generate a 3 door game with one of them having a prize 
5. Host opens a door from the remaining two that has a goat behind

6. Player 1 opts not to switch doors - stay put
7. Player 2 opts to switch doors
8. Host reveals door with price
9. Player 2 wins ~ 2x more than Player 1
